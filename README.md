# Refactoring Horiseon

## Description
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Installation

There is a Github repo link that will be provided soon to view the refactored code.

## Usage

Screenshot image is here

## Credits

Here is a link that I used to understand the assignment better. I used W3Schools to understand what semantic html elements were.

I also used this read me guide to create my this read me file.
